 <h2>First day of school</h2>
  <h4> First day of military school i didnt know anyone and, it was uncomfortable being around random kids that came to the school for maybe the same reasons.
 I walked in my room and layed eyes on my new roommate. He seemed cool with short hair and a BDU outfit on. then he explained to me i'll be spending the rest of the semester with him.</h4>

 <h2>Second day of school</h2>
  <h4>My second day of military school consisted of making my bed in the morning and shaving. Shaving wasn't something I always did. Making my cheecks look like a baby's butt I walked around outside of the room and heard a yell "Delta company outside infront of your rooms..10...9...8...etc.". First seargent taking accountability.</h4>

   <h2> Making my bed was supposed to be easy</h2>
     <h4>The moment my squad leader walked in my room I was telling myself I'm gonna fail this inspection or what ever. Then he laughed and called my PL over and showed him how great out room is. That was the happiest I was since i've been here. </h4>

      <h2>The Standard</h2>
       <h4>The standard, a samll red book that states that every cadet in the core has to follow the given rules or your a "60%" cadet. A 60% cadet basically does the exact opposite of the other 40%. I however have the biggest ego a human can have, so I started to read the standard and start practicing my general orders. Third day I was going to tell my squad leader my general orders and got them all wrong.</h4>

        <h2>Marching</h2> 
         <h4>Marching was a huge part of the school and clearly I don't know how to march because it's only been 4 days since i've been here. I asked one of our platoon seargents what to do and they said "Read the Standard!". I rolled my eyes and waited till I get yelled at.</h4>

         <h2>Mess</h2>
          <h4>Mess was a term for breakfast, lunch, dinner etc. I was surprised by the word mess and why we called the terms for these meals "mess". one early morning someone said "get ready for mess" I thought they said "Mass" so I was surprised they worshiped in the morning.</h4>

            <h2>Life</h2>
              <h4> As the day's passed I grew to think and realize theres no leaving theres no hiding and I have to face the fact that this is my new home. A home away from home.</h4>

           <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            <h4> Cleaning every morning for the rest of my days here was just the beginning of my change. Every morning my roommate and I would vise versa sweep the floors and take out the trash. At first we would clean the crap out of our room. As the days passed the cleaning got longer and we got lazier.</h4>
