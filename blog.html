 <h2>First day of school</h2>
  <h4> First day of military school i didnt know anyone and, it was uncomfortable being around random kids that came to the school for maybe the same reasons.
 I walked in my room and layed eyes on my new roommate. He seemed cool with short hair and a BDU outfit on. then he explained to me i'll be spending the rest of the semester with him.</h4>
